## 📊 Dataset Overview

Phenotypic data recorded for **100 plant genotypes** (`G1` – `G100`).
Each genotype is described by one ID and five measured/scored traits:

### 📋 Recorded Variables

| Variable | What it means |
|:---:|---|
| `Genotype`<br>**Genotype ID** | Unique code given to each plant line (`G1` – `G100`) |
| `L`<br>**Length** | Total plant length (height), base to tip in **cm** |
| `B`<br>**Breadth** | Canopy width at its widest point in **cm** |
| `SL`<br>**Shoot Length** | Length of the above-ground shoot in **cm** |
| `RL`<br>**Root Length** | Length of the primary root system in **cm** |
| `LC`<br>**Leaf Colour** | Visual score: *Light Green · Green · Dark Green* |

> 💡 **Field note:** `SL` and `RL` are the standard abbreviations used in seedling-vigor
> research, and `LC` is typically scored against a **Leaf Colour Chart (LCC)** 
> a simple, visual standard developed by IRRI.

## 🗂️ Project Modules

Five numbered scripts runnig them in order, each one builds on the previous data.

| SR | Project name | Script name | What it does (in plain words) | Packages |
|:-:|--------|--------|-------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Exploratory Data Analysis** | [`exploratory_data_analysis`] | summary stats, correlations, bar & scatter plots | `readxl` `dplyr` `ggplot2` |
| 2 | **ANOVA & Post-Hoc Test** | [`anova_and_posthoc`] | Checks if genotypes truly differ (One-Way ANOVA) and ranks them (Duncan's Test); exports `.png` boxplots | `agricolae` |
| 3 | **Linear Regression** | [`linear_regression`] | Predicts one trait from another, reports R² and residual offsets diagnostics | `stats` `ggplot2` |
| 4 | **Clustering & PCA** | [`genotype_clustering_pca`] | Scales traits (Z-score), groups similar genotypes (K-Means, K = 3), visualizes with PCA biplots | `factoextra` `stats` |
| 5 | **Shiny Dashboard** | [`shiny_dashboard`] | A web app to filter and plot traits — no coding needed to explore | `shiny` `dplyr` `ggplot2` |

### ❓ The Question Each Step Answers

| Step | Question |
|:---:|---|
|  `1` | *What does my data look like?* |
|  `2` | *Are the genotypes really different and which ones are the best?* |
|  `3` | *Can one trait predict another?* *(indirect selection)* |
|  `4` | *Which genotypes are alike and which are diverse enough for crossing?* |
|  `5` | *Can I explore the results without writing code?* |
